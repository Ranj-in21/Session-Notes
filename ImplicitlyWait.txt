Implicit Wait
--------------

[Pick up time is 9 AM
Max wait time is 15 mins
Cab arrives at 9:05 AM
Will you board immediately or wait for 15 mins?
You will board immediately
If you wait, you'll be delayed]

Application architecture is microservice architecture
Eg., Salesforce
Each microservice architecture is loading individual elements
Not all the elements will not be loaded at 0s.

Need to learn: what is microservice architecture

When try to interact with a webelement using Selenium WebDriver--> 

In Salesforce --> class name = "slds-waffle-icon"	No Such Element Exception	
Time delay in the script and application

Wait -> to address timing difference between script & app
	to make the script & application sync

Selenium Wait
--------------
1. Implicitly Wait
2. Explicitly Wait	for single WebElement

Java Wait	(Type of Explicit Wait)
---------- 
Thread.sleep(time)	10000 = 10s		
It will wait for the entire 10s, though the webelement is loaded at 5s.
It will slown down the execution. This has to be applied wherever(timing issue) needed.
It will wait till the end of the time limit
Java wait is not recommended to use in Selenium


Impliitly wait --- apply in the beginning of the script
Syntax: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds);
Industry standard time : 30s
>30s - end users won't prefer - slow application
common wait for all the webelements

- Implicitly Wait is a common wait for all the elemnets in the script (findElement, findElements)
- It is used to avoid the NoSuchElementException when the element is loaded little late
- If the element is loaded within the time limit, it  will locate the element immediately and proceed with the next step in the script.
- If the element is not loaded within the time limit, it  will throw NoSuchElementException
- Best practice is to apply ImplicitlyWait at the starting of the script
